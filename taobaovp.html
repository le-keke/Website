                            <h5>Subtle Movements and Low-Torque Gestures</h5>
                            <p>There exists an inverse relationship between users' duration of use and their level of physical fatigue. Applications that require large-scale bodily movements (such as motion-based games) tend to have shorter usage durations, whereas passive experiences like watching films in a reclining position allow for longer engagement.</p>
                            <p>In the context of shopping applications, even though certain interactive features (such as product placement through spatial gestures) may require more extensive user motion, the overall experience should be optimized for a seated posture to minimize fatigue and enhance comfort.</p>
                            <p>Variations in gesture amplitude also lead to changes in torque, which directly influence user fatigue. Designers should avoid interaction models that use the shoulder as a pivot point or require rotation of the entire arm, as these generate longer moment arms and higher torque, thus demanding greater physical effort. Instead, interaction gestures should be designed to rely primarily on wrist or finger movements, which are more efficient and sustainable for prolonged use.</p>

                        <p>Once the key functions are defined, the next step in building a complete application is to organize them into a navigational structure aligned with the user's journey. Following the principle of familiarity, primary-level sections include product flow, search, and video, with the home page continuing to serve as the hub for product distribution. Secondary-level sections comprise product details, brand spaces, and multi-product comparison. The overall hierarchy is kept within three levels to maintain clarity. Functional spaces are further categorized into shared environments and immersive environments based on their interaction characteristics.</p>

Bounding box dimensions and Z-axis offsets are predefined. Given the integration of 100,000 products, existing white-background images are used instead of rendering each product in 3D within the homepage grid. This approach reduces production costs while ensuring the home page remains efficient for rapid product browsing and distribution.</p>

                        <p>Given the wide variety of product categories and size ranges, a 1:1 default scale would make small items difficult to notice (e.g., rings, watches) and large items unwieldy to interact with or partially intersect with the user or interface panels (e.g., furniture, vehicles). Therefore, the default display size rules for product models are defined as follows:</p>
                        <p><span style="color: #666;">If the longest dimension of a model is less than 30cm, it is displayed at double scale.<br>If the longest dimension is between 30cm and 200cm, it is displayed at a size of 60cm.</span></p>

                        <p>User-initiated scaling allows for detailed observation of products. To prevent models from becoming too large and intersecting with the user or interface panels, or too small to manipulate, the following tiered scaling rules are applied based on product size:</p>
                        <p><span style="color: #666;">1-For models with a longest dimension under 15cm: maximum scale ×2, minimum scale 1:1.<br>2-For models with a longest dimension between 15cm and 50cm: maximum scale ×2, minimum scale such that the longest dimension is 15cm (68% of real size).<br>3-For models with a longest dimension over 50cm: maximum scale such that the longest dimension is 100cm, minimum scale 30% of real size.</span></p>
                        <p>Additionally, a 1:1 button is provided for users who wish to view the product at actual size. For large items, this action enlarges the model away from the user as expected.</p>

                        <p>The model can rotate along the X-axis to view front and back details, and along the Z-axis to view left and right details, allowing inspection from all angles. After a pinch-and-release gesture, the model continues to rotate along the Z-axis with inertia before stopping, while the X-axis automatically returns to the default angle (0°). To accommodate this release-and-reset behavior, the model is designed to rotate sufficiently within a limited arm swing to reveal at least the back side (180°). Finally, rotation speed is optimized to convey a sense of product weight.</p>

                        <p>Users can use pinch-and-drag gestures to move the model near the floor. Once the placement cue is triggered, releasing the model causes it to automatically drop onto the surface. If the surface is less than 100cm from the headset (such as placing on a table while seated) the placement trigger distance is 18cm. If the surface is more than 100cm away (such as placing on the floor while standing) the trigger distance is 50cm. This distinction ensures sufficient floating space, preventing the model from dropping prematurely and allowing users to examine the product without interruption.</p>

Once the placement cue is triggered, releasing the model causes it to automatically snap onto the surface. Each product model is assigned a placement face during storage (for example, lamps and range hoods use the top face, while air conditioners and paintings use the back face). Based on surface detection, the model automatically rotates to align the placement face with the surface, with the model's center positioned between the placement face center and the headset center. This ensures that, regardless of angle, the model rotates to place the designated face parallel to the surface, with the front side facing the user.</p>

Upon release, as the model drops or continues downward, the ring's radial gradient center shifts from 0% to the edge, reflecting the expansion of the product's bottom shadow. Once the model is fully placed on the surface, the ring becomes a thin outline and then fades out.</p>
