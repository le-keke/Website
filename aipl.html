                            <h5>AIPL</h5>
                            <p>Brands use the traffic channels and digital marketing products provided by the E-commerce platform to reach and acquire target customer segments and conduct continuous customer relationship management. Based on the customer behavioral definition of e-commerce platforms, the brand's customer groups structure can be further split into four layers of AIPL customer attributes by stage:</p>
                            <p><span style="font-weight: 600;">A-Awareness, Silent Customer Group: </span><br>Brand store follower, low-frequency browsing, no purchase.</p>
                            <p><span style="font-weight: 600;">I-Interest, Potential Customer Group: </span><br>Brand store follower, high-frequency browsing, no purchase.</p>
                            <p><span style="font-weight: 600;">P-Purchase, Active Customer Group: </span><br>Brand store follower, high-frequency browsing, low-frequency purchasing.</p>
                            <p><span style="font-weight: 600;">L-Loyalty, Loyalty Customer Group: </span><br>Brand store follower, high-frequency browsing, high-frequency purchase.</p>
                            <p>Customer acquisition of level n = base increment of level n + stock conversion from level n-1.</p>
                            <p>If participating in large promotions a few times a year is a means for brands to focus on acquiring and growing an active customer group (e.g. 618, Double 11, etc.), then daily marketing tools can help brands to reach, promote and convert the silent group gained by participating in marketing activities, and continuously optimize the customer group structure in the long tail phase.</p>
                            <p><span style="color: #999999;">*Daily marketing tools include check-in, sharing task, reservation, etc.</span></p>
                            <p>Through the data, we can find that different brands in different categories present a completely different four-tier customer group structure. Generally speaking, silent customers are the majority, consumer electronics brands are linearly narrowing layer by layer, cell phone brands have a higher proportion of potential and active middle-waist customers, and FMCG food brands have a larger proportion of loyal customers. From another point of view, it shows that different brands have different needs for converting customer segments, then they need to design and use targeted daily marketing tools and refine their operations. </p>

                            <h5>Design Methods for Daily Marketing Products</h5>
                            <p>The underlying logic of the business of daily marketing products is that tiered benefits are exchanged for incremental growth and conversion of brands' tiered customers. Specific marketing tools contain specific types of rights and benefits, and convert specific tiered customer groups.</p>
                            <p><span style="font-weight: 600;">0→A: </span>from not following the brand store to following the brand store. Corresponding to weak brand-related generic benefits (cash / coupons).</p>
                            <p><span style="font-weight: 600;">A→I: </span>from no browsing to low frequency browsing. Corresponding to highly interactive, strongly brand-related content or benefits.</p>
                            <p><span style="font-weight: 600;">I→P: </span>from no purchase to purchase. Corresponding to strongly branded product-related benefits, promotional benefits.</p>
                            <p><span style="font-weight: 600;">P→L: </span>from low-frequency purchase to high-frequency purchase. Corresponding to brand scarcity benefits.</p>
                            <p><span style="color: #999999;">The types of benefits included in the 12 marketing products were reordered and positioned according to the above rules to help design further clarity of execution focus.</span></p>
                            <p><span style="color: #999999;">• Big Lottery Share: Service or Event Eligibility, Product Purchase Rights<br>• Brand Topic: Products Purchase Rights<br>• Sample Distribution: New Products, Samples<br>• Service Reservation: Service or Event Eligibility<br>• Legendary Goodies: Top Goods, New Products, Limited Goods<br>• Brand Class: Cash Bonus, Coupons, Physical Prizes, Brand Honor<br>• Q&A Contest: Large Cash Bonuses<br>• Voice Challenge: Cash Bonus, Coupons, Physical Prizes<br>• Invitation: Cash Bonus, Coupons, Physical Prizes<br>• Gift for Task: Cash Bonus, Coupons<br>• Gift for Store Following: Cash Bonus, Coupons<br>• Check-in: Cash Bonus, Coupons</span></p>
                            <p>"Figure out what characteristics the customer group targeted for conversion is and what they will be attracted to" and "how to accurately express the type of benefits through reasonable interaction and appropriate visual presentation". The benefit type corresponds to the conversion point determines the design strategy of the marketing product:</p>
                            <p>1）Define the function of the tool<br>2）Qualify the business objectives<br>3）Qualify the type of benefits<br>4）Target the conversion layer of the customer group<br>5）Describe the customer group characteristics<br>6）Set experience goals<br>7）Draw design strategy<br>8）Refine key-point<br>9）Measuring product data and customer conversion data</p>
                            <p><span style="color: #999999;">Take the service reservation marketing tool as an example:</span></p>
                            <p><span style="color: #999999;">1）Define the function of the tool: <br>Users book online to checkout and experience brand service activities offline.</span></p>
                            <p><span style="color: #999999;">2）Qualify the business objectives: <br>Service reservation tools empower brands to provide consumers with brand benefits such as activities or services, so that consumers can recognize and consume the brand from the dimension of goods or service experience and form a conversion.</span></p>
                            <p><span style="color: #999999;">3）Qualify the type of benefits: <br>Service or event eligibility.</span></p>
                            <p><span style="color: #999999;">4）Target the conversion layer of the customer group: <br>I→P, from no purchase to purchase.</span></p>
                            <p><span style="color: #999999;">5）Describe the customer group characteristics: <br>Customers are interested in the brand's products, but make purchase decisions through offline service experience before triggering purchase. Example: offline makeup trial for beauty brands, offline test drive for car brands, etc.</span></p>
                            <p><span style="color: #999999;">6）Set experience goals: <br>Customers can quickly and intuitively understand the content of brand services. <br>Customers can efficiently and conveniently complete all the operational processes of filling out, viewing and checking off appointment forms.</span></p>
                            <p><span style="color: #999999;">7）Draw design strategy: <br>Divided into two parts: service content expression and reservation form module.<br>Customers have to be interested in the services provided by the brand before they are allowed to make appointments, so the design strategy gives priority to expressing the service content.<br>Prioritizing the expression of service content information by means of rich media, structured information, product atmosphere, etc. Enhancing the information perception while reducing reading costs. Enhancing the efficiency of the completed form by means of standardized controls, consistent interaction behavior design, etc.</span></p>
                            <p><span style="color: #999999;">8）Refine key-point: <br>* Enhanced representation of header video and picture information<br>* Structured expression of basic information of service content<br>* Atmospheric expression of the overall product marketing state (image color recognition for background atmosphere)<br>* Standardized and modularized design of multi-task selection input control (service location and time selection, reservation person information input, etc.)<br>* Structured expression of information for reservation orders.</span></p>
                            <p><span style="color: #999999;">9）Measuring product data and customer conversion data: <br>* UV CTR<br>* Duration of page-stay<br>* Order generation rate<br>* Offline checkout rate<br>* I→P conversion rate<br>* Go-to-store rate and ordering rate within N days after checkout<br>* Other tiers of additions and conversions</span></p>
