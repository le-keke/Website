                            <p>Post 95’s and 00’s generation are becoming the main force of consumption in the next 10 years. Born under the Internet era, they have different consumption concepts and habits. Whether the form of mall-type e-commerce product, which has been developed for decades, is suitable for the younger generation.</p>
                            <p>To figure out the answer, I collaborated with a colleague of the consumer operation department to survey the generation, through opportunity insight, analogy analysis, and value judgment, we proposed a new type of e-commerce product.</p>
                            <p>Tisland is a social e-commerce product based on and for consumption. Compared with the closed relationship of matching a consumer and goods in mall-type e-commerce, the social-type builds the open one where consumers discover goods through the group-self building cultural community, and consume them with embedded Alibaba's products like Taobao, Eleme, Youku, etc. The “goods” means everything we can consume like music, food, place. The recommendation and endorsement of a brand or commodity would be transferred from the official roles to the consumers themselves, which not only helps increase the conversion rate but also gives space for the groups to spontaneously incubate the long-tail market.</p>

                        <p>In the 1975s, the late-era of planned economy, consumption choices were lacked. People purchased commodities mainly for the practicality. The concept was gradually changed to be personality and style pursuing in the 85's generation with the material’s getting richer thanks to the Chinese economic reform. Nowadays, the younger generation is used to co-producing and consuming content through the Internet, forming groups and trends spontaneously and quickly. What they consume is "meaning", a feeling of cultural identity and group belonging.</p>

Consumption records are the most realistic data to characterize a person's taste image. Since Alibaba's platform ecology covers consumption preference data and commodity content supply in almost all fields of clothing, food, housing, transportation and play, it is possible to collect these data and supply to create a large and comprehensive contextual platform to aggregate groups from various fields for content consumption.</p>

At the same time, users make multiple self-definitions and group join by publishing consumed products or content.</p>
                        <p>The information structure is divided into three circles:<br>1.
